    Hi there! My name is James, and I'm a 1st year university student from Canada. I live in Vaughan, Ontario with my
    mom, my dad, and my cat Sapphire.
  </p>
  <p>I'm passionate about many different subjects, including math, science, computers and technology, music, and
    languages. In my spare time, I play piano; listen to, write, and arrange music; watch YouTube; read books, both
    fiction and non-fiction; and much more. My hobbies tend to go in cycles as my interests change.</p>
  <p>I am attending the University of Toronto, working towards a BSc in life sciences with the goal of either
    completing a PhD or becoming a medical specialist. I am passionate about medical sciences and hope to use my
    undergraduate experience to explore different branches of the subject while gaining research experience. Some of
    my areas of interest currently include pharmacology, physiology, and neuroscience, especially as they relate to
    improving the lives of people living with chronic disabilities or mental illnesses. I also love languages and hope
    to one day become fluent in French.</p>
