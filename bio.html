    <p>Hi there! My name is James, and I'm a Grade 12 student from Canada. I live in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) with my mom, my dad, and my cat Sapphire.</p>
    <p>I'm passionate about many different subjects, including math, science, computers and technology, music, and languages. In my spare time, I play piano; listen to, write, and arrange music; watch YouTube; read books, both fiction, and non-fiction; and much more. My hobbies tend to go in cycles as my interests change.</p>
    <p>I plan to complete an undergraduate in life sciences with the goal of either completing a PhD or becoming a medical specialist. I am passionate about medical sciences and hope to use my undergraduate experience to explore different branches of the subject while gaining research experience. Some of my areas of interest currently include pharmacology, physiology, and neuroscience, especially as they relate to improving the lives of people living with chronic disabilities or mental illnesses. I also love languages and hope to become fluent in French by completing a minor or certification.</p>
